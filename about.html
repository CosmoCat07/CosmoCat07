    <div id="aboutText"><p class="text1" style="font-size: 32px">I am CosmoCat07, or CosmoCat19 on streams. I am a teenager who is obsessed with technology, and cats. I enjoy coding in my free time, and am also an avid reader. Academically, my favorite subject is math. I also enjoy streaming, and setting up technology. Every day, I spend hours gaming with my real life friends. Right now, my favorite games to play are Spellbreak, Minecraft, Dauntless, and when playing by myself, Enter the Gungeon. Other things I do in my day-to-day life include parkour classes, eating, and annoying my younger brother. I am not very athletic, but I do enjoy watching football, particularly the Steelers.
